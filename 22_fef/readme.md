#DISCO: The Tailwind dark mode seems to display only if firefox is set to dark mode. I tried with a theme that was sort of dark (spaceship) and tailwind did not use the dark mode. Despite the styling of the button taking up the entire width of the page, only if you click in the center of the page will it redirect you to a link. The loading bar and image carousels were a bootstrap function which helped open my eyes to just how many websites used bootstrap for their website's features.


#QCC: Is there a way to toggle darkmode on and off through html buttons? Can we stretch the entire button so that if you click on any colored area it will redirect you to a link? For the loading bar, how do you actually implement the progress of how much of the website has actually loaded with the loading bar? I see that the two side arrows move to the midpoint of the images every time you click it to turn to the next image. I think the images should all be the same dimension or have the arrows stay at a certain point so that the users don't have to constantly move their mouse to click the arrows. I think it would be nice if there was a way to keep all three text boxes open when you click on them to show more details.

#q0 (Did you have to consult resources beyond your Devo-generated on-ramp? Your answer should be a single binary digit.): 0
#q0b If answer to preceding question is 1, cite all resources consulted -- including verbal consultations and/or neighbouring team's readme. 1citation/line.):
#q1 (only to be answered after you have finished... At this point, which FEF do you prefer, and why? Your answer to this Q should be the only portion of your submission that differs from that of your teammate.): I think currently I lean torwards tailwind for the customization. The problem with framework and bootstrap is that the customization is more complicated and requires multiple files and learning how to use SASS / editing a seperate css file.
